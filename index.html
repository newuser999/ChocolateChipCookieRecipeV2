      <li> Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment
   paper or lightly grease them.</li>

   <li> Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter,
   granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.</li>

   <li> Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully
   incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
  </li>

   <li>  Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and
   salt.</li>

   <li> Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture,
   mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li> 

   <li> Fold in Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed
   throughout the dough.</li>

   <li> Form Cookie Dough: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.</li>

   <li> Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges.</li>

   <li>  Cool and Enjoy: Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

   <li> Serve: Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or as a treat any time of the day!</li></ol>
